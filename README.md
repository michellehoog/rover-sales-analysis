## Analysis

The following sections are addressed:

### 1. Data Exploration  

### 2. Conversations and Bookings
For uncancelled bookings, are owners or providers more likely to leave a review? Who is more likely to leave a higher review?

### 3. Recent Daily Booking Rate
Is there a downward trend for the recent daily booking rate? Does the company have a reason to be concerned?

### 4. Take Rate Analysis
In each month, what were the gross billings,  net revenue and aggregate take rate?. Did take rate trend up or trend down or remain unchanged over time?
If it did change, why did it change?
